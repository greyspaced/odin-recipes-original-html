HTML coded repository without CSS

The current project wil demonstrate skills I've learned thus far.
Hopefully it will pinpoint areas I'm strong at and other areas I need to strenthen.

Thus far, I seem to be doing well with creating a new repository. However, needed slight help with cloning my repository. 

I definitely need more guidance to add files to the repository. As well as adding, commitiing and pushing files to GitHub.
